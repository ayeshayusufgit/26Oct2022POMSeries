to ignore irrelavent files use gitignore file


git commands
Add the .gitignore file in ur project root
git init(after running this command .git file gets created meaning this project is a git project)
git remote add origin https://github.com/ayeshayusufgit/26Oct2022POMSeries.git
(The above command is used to make connection of the local repo with the remote repo in github)
git status (give the list of untracked files which needs to be pushed)
git add .	(add these files to a bucket so that these files can be pushed after that)
git status	(files in green are those which are added to the bucket,ready to be commited)
git commit -m "reason"	(commit will not push the code, the correct reason needs to be provided)
git push origin master	(by default pushing the code in the master branch of the remote repository of github)
#the code is pushed from the local->master copy to remote->mater copy

Some files which are unimportant files(some unnecessary result folders like allure-result, 
screenshots, test-output, build etc, then .class file, .jar file, .war file,pom.xml backup 
file only java code needs to be pushed) which are not required to be pushed so these types 
of files need to be mentioned in the .gitignore file
 
 .gitignore file is a hidden file and cannot be seen in the in eclipse etc
