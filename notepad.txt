To generate allure report
cd s>allure serve allure-results

works fine with parallel execution
supported by jenkins


to ignore irrelavent files use gitignore file


git commands
=====================================================
1.Create a new repo at the github
Add the .gitignore file in ur project root
git init(after running this command .git file gets created meaning this project is a git project)
git remote add origin https://github.com/ayeshayusufgit/26Oct2022POMSeries.git
(The above command is used to make connection of the local repo with the remote repo in github)
git status (give the list of untracked files which needs to be pushed)
git add .	(add these files to a bucket so that these files can be pushed after that)
git status	(files in green are those which are added to the bucket,ready to be commited)
git commit -m "reason"	(commit will not push the code, the correct reason needs to be provided)
git push origin master	(by default pushing the code in the master branch of the remote repository of github)
#the code is pushed from the local->master copy to remote->mater copy

Some files which are unimportant files(some unnecessary result folders like allure-result, 
screenshots, test-output, build etc, then .class file, .jar file, .war file,pom.xml backup 
file only java code needs to be pushed) which are not required to be pushed so these types 
of files need to be mentioned in the .gitignore file
 
 .gitignore file is a hidden file and cannot be seen in the in eclipse etc

2.A new team member joins the team:
Get the repo url https://github.com/ayeshayusufgit/BigBazaarRestAssuredFW.git

Clone the repo/project git clone https://github.com/ayeshayusufgit/BigBazaarRestAssuredFW.git

Import the project in ur eclipse->using projects->existing maven project
(once u import the project it start building)
 
Start using it.

git add .
git status
git commit -m "comment"
git push origin master
============================================================================
local branching process in github(edit->commit->push]
git branch	// to find out the branches
From the master branch, create a new branch->git branch profilepage
Make some changes in the profilepage branch
git add .
git commit -m "reason"
git push origin profilepage //to create the branch if not there in the remote n push the code there
Raise a pull request(PR) in github and get approval
Merge the profilepage branch code to the master branch in github
Master branch should reflect the changes coming from profilepage branch
==============================================================================
Pull Process
A team member has added some code to remote->master
In the local switch the branch to the master->git checkout master
Take the latest pull from the master->git pull origin master
Switch to the profilepage branch->git checkout profilepage
Merge the code from master to the profilepage->git merge master

 A new team member joins:
Get the repo url https://github.com/ayeshayusufgit/BigBazaarRestAssuredFW.git

Clone the repo/project git clone https://github.com/ayeshayusufgit/BigBazaarRestAssuredFW.git

Import the project in ur eclipse->using projects->existing maven project
 
Start working on a feature in the feature branch
git branch register
git checkout register

Make the changes in the register branch

git add <filename>
git commit -m "reason"
git push origin register
raise a pr in github and get the approval
merge the register branch to the master branch in github
master branch should reflect the changes coming from register

 Conflicts:

docker commands
docker -v => gives the docker version
docker ps -a => gives the docker containers running
docker images => gives the docker images
docker pull selenium/hub
docker pull selenium/node-chrome-debug
docker pull selenium/node-firefox-debug

docker run -d =>the container will be created from the image in detached mode
(do not show me the logs n run in the backend) such that after the container is created the console is released
and the next command can be executed

docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --name selenium-hub -P selenium/hub
The docker hub server container running on 4444 port number as per industry standards
Selenium Hub running on 4444 connected to Docker on 4444, -name is used for any name
to be provided to the container, -P is used to mention the image from which the 
container has to be created. 
"c81e9cfdb2f486f0e7f2e02dbcb95a3b56f8c4e2070b4ca6a86f724b60645c59" is the container id after creation
 
To link the selenium hub with the nodes
docker run -d -P --link selenium-hub:hub selenium/node-chrome-debug
is used to create a selenium chrome container and --link
is used to link the selenium hub(called selenium-hub which is the "hub" ie the selenium grid server) 
with the selenium chrome container nodes
selenium/node-chrome-debug is the image name used

docker run -d -P --link selenium-hub:hub selenium/node-firefox-debug
